# Code to Cure: Digital Healthcare Appointment System

**Code to Cure** is a web-based solution designed to digitize the manual registration and appointment systems in Ethiopia's healthcare centers. 

## 🏥 The Problem
Current healthcare registration in Ethiopia is largely manual, leading to:
- **Physical Queues:** Patients wait in long lines just to book a visit.
- **Data Loss:** Manual paper slips are easily damaged or lost.
- **Accessibility:** Patients outside the capital struggle to coordinate with hospital schedules.

## 🚀 The Solution
- **Dual Language:** Fully functional in **Amharic** and **English**.
- **Real-time Booking:** Patients select available dates based on doctor schedules.
- **Digital Records:** Keeps track of registration and diagnosis history digitally.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
- **Backend:** **Python Flask**.
- **Database:** **MongoDB** (for user accounts and patient booking).
